# Yahtzee API
Welcome to the Yahtzee API! This package provides the core functionalities to programmatically play a game of Yahtzee. The purpose of this package is for use with custom OpenAI Gym reinforcement learning environments (in development), however it is generalized for many different use cases including simple algorithm development. Currently the API is still pre version 1.0.0 and is being iterated rapidly so stability should not be taken for granted until 1.0.0 is released. See below for a further note on versioning.

This package is composed of two classes: the Game class and the Player class. The Game class provides the general structure and manages advancing turns and determining the winner. 
Instantiating a Game object will create a list of Player objects that can be interacted with using the methods outlined in the docs at https://yahtzee-api.tomarbeiter.com.

### Installation
To install this package, run `pip install yahtzee-api`

### Documentation
For complete documentation on the current API methods, please visit https://yahtzee-api.tomarbeiter.com.

### Example
The following is an example of a simple (and really poorly performing!) algorithm playing a 1-player game of Yahtzee with the Yahtzee API:

```python
from yahtzee_api.game import Game

game = Game(1)  # Specify number of players

for i in range(13):     # Iterate for each turn
    game.current_player.roll_dice([True, True, True, True, True])   # Roll all 5 dice
    game.current_player.print_theoretical_scorecard()               # Print out all possible scores based on roll
    index = 0
    max_score = 0
    for entry in game.current_player.theoretical_scorecard:     # Choose the highest possible score from that roll
        if entry[0] >= max_score and entry[2] > 0:
            max_score = entry[0]
            index = game.current_player.theoretical_scorecard.index(entry)
    game.current_player.end_turn(index)         # End turn by scoring the max value
    game.players[0].print_scorecard()
    result = game.next_player()                 # Advances global turn because there is only 1 player

print("Winner: ", result[0].player_name)        # Print out post-game results
print("Score: ", result[0].score)
result[0].print_scorecard()
```
This algorithm is obviously not going to win you any Yahtzee games (it never even rerolls the dice!), but demonstrates some of the core functionalities of the API. I recommend viewing the documentation in tandem with this example to fully understand what each method does/returns. 

### A Note on Versioning
This project is my first headfirst dive into the world of publishing Python packages, using Sphinx for documentation, GitHub Actions, etc. As such, there are plenty of junk commits and mistakes in the repo. I've done my best to clean it up and make sure that what is presented is accurate, up-to-date, and at least somewhat helpful. 
Canonically, v0.1.2 is the first release of this package. Yes, v0.1.0 and v0.1.1 existed, but both fell victim to my inexperience with Python publishing (amongst other things). From v0.1.2 on, all changes and versioning will following semantic versioning guidelines specified by https://semver.org/.
